preserved registers (callee-saved)
	rbp, rbx, rsp, r12, r13, r14, r15

scratch registers (caller-saved)
	rax, rcx, rdx, rsi, rdi, r8, r9, r10, r11

A called function is allowed to overwrite scratch registers without restrictions.
The values of preserved registers must remain unchanged across function calls.
Most functions begin with a "push rbp", which backups rbp on the stack.
